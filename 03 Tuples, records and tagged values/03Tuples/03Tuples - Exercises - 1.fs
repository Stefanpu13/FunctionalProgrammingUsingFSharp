        A time of day can be represented as a triple (hours, minutes, f) where f is either AM or PM
        â€“ or as a record. Declare a function to test whether one time of day comes before another. For
        example, (11,59,"AM") comes before (1,15,"PM"). Make solutions with triples as well
        as with records. Declare the functions in infix notation.
